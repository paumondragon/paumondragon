### Â¡Hola!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a librarian who enjoys learning. I love geography, non-fiction literature, History and data analysis and its visualization. I've been studying Data Analysis and here you will find the projects I've been working on.

You can also find me on [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulina-mondragon/)
